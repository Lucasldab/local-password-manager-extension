# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons. You need to create the following icon files:

- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon
- `icon-96.png` - 96x96 pixel icon

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software like:
- GIMP (free)
- Inkscape (free)
- Adobe Photoshop
- Figma (online)

## Icon Design

The icons should represent a password manager with a lock or key symbol. Here are some suggestions:

1. A simple lock icon with a gradient background
2. A key and lock combination
3. A shield with a lock
4. A padlock with a modern design

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Sizes: 48x48 and 96x96 pixels
- Background: Transparent or solid color
- Style: Should match the extension's design theme (purple/blue gradient)

## Quick Icon Creation

If you don't have design software, you can use online tools like:
- Canva
- Figma
- Icon generators

Or use emoji-based icons by creating simple PNG files with lock emojis (üîê) on a colored background.
